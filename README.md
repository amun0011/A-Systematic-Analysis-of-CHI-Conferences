# A Systematic Analysis of CHI Conferences
HCI or Human Computer Interaction has been a diversified field (Nicola Dell, 2016), a growing area in research and an inter-discipline of computer science, behavioral/cognitive linguistic science and usability/human factors aimed at designing user friendly computer technology by improving the interactions between human being and computer systems. Though started exploration since 80s, HCI research has grown predominantly (Kostakos, 2014) since the commencement of 21st century because of the popularity of mobile devices, social networks and internet technology. However, with all these fame, CHI conferences came under criticism for not developing motor themes systematically (Kostakos, 2015), the heart of any discipline, and was under the question of whether HCI could qualify to become a scientific discipline. Our study, therefore, seeks to provide a complete systematic analysis of CHI proceedings happened between 1982 and 2018 to understand certain features of HCI research such as (1) how CHI conferences have emerged with new trends and techniques, (2) what are the shortfalls or gaps (if at all) in HCI research that remained unsolved over the years and (3) was there any opportunity created to broaden the field or to solve any gaps in terms of notable contributions or knowledge additions. In doing so, our work follows a unique approach to utilize the full text corpus of these proceedings to develop an unsupervised machine learning model, namely topic model, and visualize the generated topics in human interpretable forms in order to summarize the findings such as trends, contributions or gaps. Using this methodology, we observed that CHI conferences notably grew with new trends and techniques, broadening the field significantly for the past 37 years; however, at the same time, they also experienced significant shifts in research focus, leaving behind certain knowledge gaps. Finally, our work not only confines itself into a systematic study of the CHI proceedings but also offers a new method to study any discipline using data science, not biased by expert language or prior knowledge.
